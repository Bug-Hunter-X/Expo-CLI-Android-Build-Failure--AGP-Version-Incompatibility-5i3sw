This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android application.  The build process fails with an error related to the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version incompatibility. The exact error message can vary but often involves a conflict between the AGP version specified in the project's `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file and the version expected by Expo's build system. This can happen when updating Expo CLI, Android Studio, or Gradle itself.  The project may build successfully on some machines but fail on others due to variations in Gradle and AGP versions.
