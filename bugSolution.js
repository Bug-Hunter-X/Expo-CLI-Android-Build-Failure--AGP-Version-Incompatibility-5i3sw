The solution involves resolving the AGP version conflict by either explicitly setting a compatible version in the `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file or by updating the Expo CLI and other relevant dependencies to versions that work harmoniously.  Sometimes cleaning the project's build cache can also help. 

**Example (gradle-wrapper.properties):**

```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6-all.zip
```

**Other Potential Solutions:**

* **Update Expo CLI:** Running `expo upgrade` to the latest version can sometimes address compatibility issues.
* **Clean the project:** Deleting the `android/build` and `android/.gradle` folders can resolve caching problems.
* **Invalidate caches/restart:** In Android Studio, invalidate caches and restart.
* **Check dependencies:**  Ensure all other dependencies (e.g., libraries used in your app) are compatible with your chosen AGP version.
